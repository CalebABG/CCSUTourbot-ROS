# CCSUTourbot-ROS

## Setup
1. **NOTE:** ROS needs to be installed! If you don't have ROS installed, install [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation)
2. Once ROS is installed, proceed to setting up a Catkin Workspace [Create a Workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace)

### Already have Catkin Workspace setup?
1. Clone this Git repo into a directory of your choice
2. Change into the root directory of the Git repo in a terminal window
3. Run the ```catkin_make``` command
4. Make sure to source the ```setup.bash``` file in `~/ros_ws/devel/setup.bash` in any active ```terminal```
5. Boom, should be all set to go from there
